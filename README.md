# MLTE

M.L.T.E. (pronounced "multi") is program extension that is used inside AutodeskÂ® Revit. It is a multiline 
text editor that can be used for editing the parameters of anything inside Revit but in a multi-line view 
instead of the single line that Revit's Properties Palette gives you. In addition to editing the values of 
parameters M.L.T.E. can also edit the formulas when used inside the Revit Family Editor. It even has syntax 
highlighting and auto-formatting to make complex nested if statements easier to follow and debug.

Refer to html_help_files.zip for detailed description of what each command does.

Make sure you also download the project "pkhCommon_strongNamed", it has utility functions that this project uses.
